# Release Puller

## Summary

Release Puller is a python tool devloped by Sam Handler for getting product sources from Release\_Tree for building a functioning environment.  Release Puller can use a variety of sources to create a list of products and versions.

## Configuration

There is a file inside of the releasepuller root directory called ReleasePuller.rc which 

This file can accept any command known to release puller.  Because of this ReleasePuller.rc can be used as a way to script the build process.  

## Usage

**note:** All the commands given can be abreviated to the letters which uniquely determines them.  For instance `add versionsource compilerequest` can be shortened to `a v co`.  We need to specify `co` instead of just `c` since `a v c` could mean `add versionsource compilerequese` or `add versionsource csuites`.
